        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>
          I am a backend engineer with over 5 years of experience based in
          Nigeria with a strong passion for solving real-world problems through
          technology. My experience spans Laravel backend development, API
          design, and working on scalable systems. I enjoy football,
          action/political thrillers, and building useful tools that make life
          easier.

        <h2>Why I Joined AltSchool</h2>
        <p>
          I joined AltSchool to improve my engineering fundamentals, upskill,
          gain exposure to structured learning, and collaborate with a community
          of like-minded developers. The program offers hands-on experience and
          access to mentors, which I believe will fast-track my growth in
          backend engineering and give me access to a wider range of
          opportunites via the "AltSchool advantage".
