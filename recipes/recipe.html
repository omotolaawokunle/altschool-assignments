        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>370 g (3 cups) of "00" flour with at least 12% protein</li>
            <li>250 ml (1 cup) of water (110°F)</li>
            <li>15 g (1 tablespoon) of extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>6 g (1 teaspoon) of fine salt</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
            <li>3 g (1 teaspoon) of active dry yeast</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Prepare the yeast:</strong> In a large bowl mix ½ the flour and the yeast. Then add the water a little at a time. Mix thoroughly with a spoon to combine all the ingredients. Let stand for 5-10 minutes until <em>foamy and bubbly</em>.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Make the dough:</strong> Now add the oil and mix well. Then add the remaining flour. Add it a little at a time and stir for 4-5 minutes, while continuing to use the spoon. Finally add the salt and mix. Mix until a <mark>shaggy dough</mark> forms.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Knead the dough:</strong> When the dough no longer sticks to the bowl, place it on your work surface dusted with flour. Knead 1 to 2 minutes with your hands. Then make a smooth, floured ball. The dough should be slightly tacky but not sticky.</li>
            
            <li><strong>First rise:</strong> Place the pizza dough back into the bowl. Cover it with plastic wrap. Then place a kitchen towel over it. Let rise at room temperature for 1 hour until <u>doubled in size</u>.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Prepare the sauce:</strong> While dough rises, combine all sauce ingredients in a bowl and mix well. Set aside to let flavors meld.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Preheat and shape:</strong> Preheat oven to <strong>475°F</strong>. Punch down dough and divide into 4 portions. Roll each into 8-inch circles on floured parchment paper.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Add toppings:</strong> Spread sauce evenly, leaving a 1-inch border for crust. Sprinkle with mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Bake to perfection:</strong> Transfer pizzas (on parchment) to baking sheets. Bake for 12-15 minutes until crust is <em>golden brown</em> and cheese is bubbly.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Finish and serve:</strong> Remove from oven, add fresh basil leaves, drizzle with olive oil, and let cool for 2-3 minutes before slicing.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Chef's Tips & Notes</h2>
        <p><strong>Perfect crust secret:</strong> For an extra crispy bottom, place a pizza stone or inverted baking sheet in the oven while preheating. Slide the pizza directly onto the hot surface.</p>
        
        <p><em>Make-ahead tip:</em> The dough can be prepared up to 3 days in advance and stored in the refrigerator. Let it come to room temperature before shaping.</p>
        
        <p><mark>Topping variety:</mark> Try pepperoni, mushrooms, bell peppers, or Italian sausage for different flavor combinations. Just remember not to overload the pizza!</p>
